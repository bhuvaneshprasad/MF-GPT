The duration of these instruments is linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument \\nor in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater than \\nwhat may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate due diligence when \\ndeciding to make their investments.NAV (AS ON JUNE 28, 2024)  NAV PER UNIT ( `)\\nEXIT LOAD$$ :\\nNil'"
